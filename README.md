Simple Amazon Polly Audiobook Creation Program

If you want to create audiobooks with amazon polly , you will need to create an AWS account, and get an aws key, and aws secret key. 
Once you have that information, you will need to put the codes into the main program. 

Once you have done that, make sure to have the text file that you want to create an audiobook from in the same folder, as the main program.py, and run it like : "python amazonpolly.py" . 

If you have done everything correct, it will be converting the text into mp3 format.
